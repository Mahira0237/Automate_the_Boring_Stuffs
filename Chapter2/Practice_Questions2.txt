1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

True and False. They are written with their first letter in upperrcase(T or F) 
and the rest in lowercase.

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

and, or, not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of 
Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

and:
True and True       True
True and False      False
False and True      False
False and False     False

or:
True or True       True
True or False      True
False or True      True
False or False     False

not:
not True        False
not False       True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                            False
not (5 > 4)                                     True                
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                             False
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                       True
(True and True) and (True == False)             False
(not False) or (not True)                       True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

==      Equal to
!=      Not equal to
<       Less than
>       Greater than
<=      Less than or equal to
>=      Greater than or equal to

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as each other.
The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable on the left.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

A condition is an expression that evaluates to True or False. We would usa a condition
when there are different course of action required for the different evaluations. 
For example: To check whether a number is odd or even.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')       #1
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')  #2
    else:
        print('ham')    #3
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. 9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, 
prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

import random
spam= random.randint(1,3)
if spam = '1':
    print('Hello')
if spam = '2':
    print('Howdy')
else print('Greetings!')

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

CTRL + C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

When the program execution reaches a continue statement, the program execution 
immediately jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loopâ€™s condition. 

In case of the break statemet, the execution jumps out of the loop.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

No functional difference. In all cases, the index starts from 0 and mantains a step of 1.

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

For:

For i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

while:

i=1
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, 
how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
