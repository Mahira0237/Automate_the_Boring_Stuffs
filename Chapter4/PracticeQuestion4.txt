1. What is []?

This is an empty list that does not contain any values

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? 
(Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

spam = [2,4,6,8,10]
spam[2]='hello'

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?

c

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

d

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

['a','b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

+ and *

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

The append() method call adds the argument to the end of the list. 
The insert() method can insert a value at any index in the list.

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

del statement and remove() method

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

Many of the things you can do with lists can also be done with strings and other values of 
sequence types: indexing; slicing; and using them with for loops, with len(), and with the in and not in operators.

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

tuples are immutable and and types with parentheses ().

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

value = (42)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

tuple([value])
list[(value)]

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain 
instead?

reference

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value 
like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference.

If the list we need to copy contains lists, then the copy.deepcopy() function 
will copy these inner lists as well.
